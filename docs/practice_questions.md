# Practice Questions and Key Concepts

Below are practice questions to solidify your understanding, followed by tables of key terms and fundamental propositions about architecture and the model registry.

## Practice Questions
1. What problem did the original flat model registry cause when multiple vendors provided the same model?
2. How does the new `_models_by_vendor` structure solve this issue?
3. Why do we keep the `available_models` dictionary, and what vendor does it prefer by default?
4. Imagine adding a new vendor tomorrow. What part of the design makes this simpler?
5. When might you still use `get_model()` without specifying a vendor?
6. Give a real life analogy that explains why storing vendor information separately helps.
7. What is a factory method in `AIModel` and why might we use it?
8. How does the registry pattern relate to a phone book or a library catalog?
9. Explain how the Fa√ßade pattern shows up in this code change.
10. What happens if you request a model that is not available for a specified vendor?

## Everyday Analogy
Think of a grocery store where the same fruit can come from different farms. If you only label bins by fruit type, you might lose track of which farm each piece came from. By having sub-bins for each farm, you can select oranges from Farm A or Farm B depending on your preference.
